# PR Summary: Release 0.2.0 Stabilization

## Overview
This PR finalizes the stabilization phase prior to strategy unification by refining conversation closing logic, strengthening test infrastructure, enforcing prompt lint standards, and ensuring schema + prompt system alignment. All test suites now pass (15/15, 106 tests) with a deterministic compiled prompt hash.

## Key Changes
- Pure closing detection: Introduced `shouldTriggerClosing` + `applyClosingTrigger` for explicit state mutation & telemetry emission.
- Negative sentiment & completion safety: Added terms (`leave`, `annoying`); completion phrases ignored when used in questions.
- Strategy harness test resilience: Predicate-based assertions for prompt modification markers.
- Schema compliance: Added location field to fixture to satisfy `anyOf` requirement.
- Prompt hygiene: Wrapped long lines to meet internal 220-char lint without semantic change; updated Hume prompt test to structural assertions.
- Test infra: Enabled TSX + jsdom; added `timers.test.tsx`; removed legacy duplicate test causing parse errors.
- Sanitize export: Restored `sanitizeForHume` for test usage.
- Recap expectation: Adjusted to reflect implemented completeness heuristic.

## Tooling & Config
- Jest config: jsdom environment, ts-jest JSX transform override.
- Prompt lint: passes with hash `5387c368e7`.
- Version bump: `0.1.0` -> `0.2.0`.
- Changelog updated with 0.2.0 section.

## Telemetry Integrity
Closing events now only emitted via `applyClosingTrigger`; avoids silent double-fires. Additional telemetry types validated by passing integration tests.

## Risk & Mitigation
- Closing logic refactor: Mitigated by comprehensive integration + sentiment tests.
- Prompt wrapping: Verified by unchanged semantic segments & passing evaluation tests.
- Test infra changes: All suites green; component test isolated.

## Follow-Up (Not in Scope Here)
- Strategy unification (single env + RANDOM selection & gating).
- Telemetry persistence (Firestore sink) & correlation IDs.
- Autosave/resume incremental drafts.
- Further recap completeness heuristics.

## Verification
Run: `npm test --silent` -> 15/15 passing.
