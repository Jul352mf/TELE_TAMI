# Template Overview

This file summarizes the original starter template (hume-evi-next-js-starter) to clarify what was inherited.

## Original Features
- Basic Next.js App Router project skeleton.
- Simple Hume EVI Voice integration example.
- Minimal styling and single persona prompt.
- Single tool definition (`recordLead`) with basic schema.

## Missing in Template (Added Here)
- Multi-persona & interview modes.
- Sheets + Email integration via Functions & extension.
- Retention sweep & compliance planning.
- Prompt modularization & incremental tools.
- Rich UI components (timers, selectors, toasts, theme handling).

## Rationale for Divergence
Enhancements focus on reliability (schema validation, retries), experimentation (modular prompt, feature flags), and operational readiness (retention, consent modes).
