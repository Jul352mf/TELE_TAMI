- Variants: list labels (A, B, etc.) referencing config flags or hashes.
- Metrics: define quantitative where possible (e.g., avg confirmations/lead, lead completion rate, session drop rate).
- Result: concise summary after evaluation window.
- Decision: keep, revert, modify.
- Follow-up: next experiment or action.
